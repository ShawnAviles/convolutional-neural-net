# convolutional-neural-net

Building a Convolutional Neural Network for distance recognition
- applied to determine how far a tree is from the camera in a provided photo. 

This was completed as the final research project for my Quantitative Biology Class.

The dataset was provided by the professor.

Library used to create the CNN:
- Tensorflow
